You are an expert software reviewer. Review the following code changes against the task requirements.
Task: {task.title}
Description: {task.description}

Requirements:

Code Diff:

Your task is to identify if the implementation is complete, correct, and follows best practices.
- Identify missing edge cases.
- Identify architectural drift.
- Identify security risks not caught by static scans.

Return a JSON object with 'is_satisfactory' and a list of 'findings' (as Gap objects).
